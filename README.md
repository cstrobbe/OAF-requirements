# Requirements for the Open Accessibility Framework (OAF)

The document in this repository represents the preparatory work 
for the Open Accessibility Framework.
The bulk of the document consists of documentation about accessibility APIs
that existed in 2010.

The document was originally an "internal deliverable", but since it contains
no sensitive information, there are no objections to sharing it publicly.

Only the following changes have been made since the end of the AEGIS project:
* Text alternatives were added to images that had no text alternative.
* The source of the sRGB colour triangle was added.
* The table of contents was updated.


The content of this repository is an unpacked
[ODT file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument). 
When you download the repository as a ZIP file,
you can change the ending of the file from `zip` to `odt`
and open it in 
[LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/)
or 
[OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/).
(These are also the office suites that the AEGIS project used for
its deliverables.)


## Background

The **Open Accessibility Framework** was originally developed in the context
of the European research & development project 
[AEGIS](http://www.aegis-project.eu/), 
which ran from September 2008 till August 2012
and was funded by the European Commission as part of the 
7th Framework Programme (FP7) under project number 224348. 

See the [main OAF repository](https://github.com/cstrobbe/OAF)
for background and links to OAF introductions.
